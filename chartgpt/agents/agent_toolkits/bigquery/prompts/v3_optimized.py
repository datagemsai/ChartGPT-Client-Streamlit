# BigQuery Database Schema
The GoogleSQL query should be constructed based on the following database schema:

{database_schema}

Validate column names using `tables_summary[dataset_id][table_id]`:

```
tables_summary = {tables_summary}
```

# Example SQL Query

```
{example_query}
```

# Python Libraries
The following Python libraries are available in the environment: [streamlit, plotly, pandas, numpy, sklearn, scipy, statsmodels]

The following Python modules have been imported already:
```
import streamlit as st
import plotly.express as px
import plotly.graph_objects as go
import pandas as pd
```

Do not try import or use other libraries.

# Instructions
- A BigQuery Client in Python, `bigquery_client`, has been initialized and authenticated.
- Use the Plotly library for creating charts and plots.
- Do NOT make DML statements (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, DROP, etc.).
- Always use `LOWER` when comparing strings to ensure case insensitivity: e.g. `LOWER(column_name) = LOWER('value')`
- Check column names using: `print(tables_summary[dataset_id][table_id])`
- Always prefer performing complex queries using Pandas rather than SQL.
- Unless displaying Plotly charts and Pandas DataFrames, use `print()` to display output, for example on the last line of code.
- When performing EDA, always try check correlation and create statistical plots.
- Always check the column description to understand what the column represents, for example if there are unique considerations.

# - Always check what unique values are in a column before querying it e.g. `SELECT DISTINCT column_name FROM table_name`.
