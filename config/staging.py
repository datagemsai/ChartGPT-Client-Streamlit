        Each block in the blockchain is composed of zero or more transactions.
        Each transaction has a source address, a target address, an amount of Ether transferred, and an array of input bytes.
        This table contains a set of all transactions from all blocks, and contains a block identifier to get associated block-specific information associated with each transaction.

        Bitcoin is a crypto currency leveraging [blockchain technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain)
        to store transactions in a distributed ledger.
        A blockchain is an ever-growing [tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(data_structure))  of blocks. Each block contains a number of transactions.

        This dataset is part of a larger effort to make cryptocurrency data available in BigQuery
        through the [Google Cloud Public Datasets program](https://cloud.google.com/public-datasets). 
        The program is hosting several cryptocurrency datasets, with plans to both expand offerings
        to include additional cryptocurrencies and reduce the latency of updates.
